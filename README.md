# Clue Analyzer

MADE BY JOSHUA STAHL AT SOUTH MOUNTAIN COMMUNITY COLLEGE FOR CIS156 FINAL PROJECT.

CLI created with Python. To see Windows GUI version application see 

CLUE ANALYZER was made to help the user with the deductive
reasoning process during a game of Clue. Clue is a classic murder
mystery game, where there is three cards hidden in an envelope.
(The murderer, the murder weapon, and the murder location(or room)).
This game requires a lot of deductive reasoning, and since
some people are challenged with the deductive reasoning process,
(or make silly mistakes), this program will help
the user play the game.

This program keeps track for each player:
- The player name
- The number of cards the player has
- Which cards they have
- Which cards they don't have
- Which cards we're not certain they have or not

The program uses the information known about each player and uses that along 
with the guesses made by each user to help the program's user to deduce the 
solution to the game.
